# Fee Structure Files Implementation

## Overview
The system has been modified to ensure all fee structure files are always loaded from the `fees/` folder in your project, rather than being stored elsewhere (such as in IndexedDB as base64 encoded data).

## Changes Made

### 1. Course Management Form
- **Before**: File upload input for fee structure PDFs
- **After**: Dropdown selection from available files in `fees/` folder
- The form now shows a select dropdown populated with all PDF files available in the `fees/` folder

### 2. Fee Structure Storage
- **Before**: Fee structure files were converted to base64 and stored in IndexedDB
- **After**: Only the filename is stored in the database, with the path always pointing to `fees/[filename]`
- Database now stores:
  - `feeStructureFileName`: The actual filename (e.g., "beauty.pdf")
  - `feeStructurePdf`: The path to the file (e.g., "fees/beauty.pdf")

### 3. File Loading Function
- Added `loadFeeStructureFiles()` function that:
  - Populates the dropdown with available PDF files from the fees/ folder
  - Currently includes 11 PDF files detected in your fees/ folder
  - Automatically called when navigating to Settings view and during app initialization

### 4. Download and Sharing Functions
- Updated to load files directly from the `fees/` folder
- Error messages now specifically mention "fees/ folder" for clarity
- All file operations now reference the fees/ directory path

### 5. User Interface Updates
- Settings page now explains the new fees/ folder approach
- Success messages and info displays mention "loaded from fees/ folder"
- Clear documentation about file location requirements

## Current Fee Structure Files
The system is configured to load these files from your `fees/` folder:
- Business course .pdf
- CamScanner 09-04-2025 15.55 (1).pdf
- beauty.pdf
- community health .pdf
- counseling psychology .pdf
- health services support .pdf
- lab technology .pdf
- medical lab.pdf
- medical laboratory .pdf
- opthopedic.pdf
- peri.pdf

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Data Integrity**: Files remain in their original format without base64 conversion
2. **Easy Management**: Files can be easily added, removed, or updated in the fees/ folder
3. **No Storage Bloat**: Database doesn't store large base64 encoded file data
4. **Direct Access**: Files can be accessed directly from the file system
5. **Transparency**: Clear understanding of where files are stored and loaded from

## How to Add New Fee Structure Files

1. Place the PDF file in the `fees/` folder
2. Update the `feeStructureFiles` array in the `loadFeeStructureFiles()` function to include the new filename
3. The file will then be available in the course creation dropdown

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Fee structure files are loaded using `fetch()` API from the fees/ directory
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing course records
- File paths are stored as relative paths (`fees/filename.pdf`)
- All file operations include proper error handling for missing files

This implementation ensures that fee structure files are always loaded from the `fees/` folder as requested, providing a clean and manageable approach to handling course fee structure documents.
